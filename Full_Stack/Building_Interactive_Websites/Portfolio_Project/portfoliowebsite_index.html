                    <p>I'm an aspiring software engineer passionate about using my software development skills to design and develop
                        important software, providing significant impact and contributing to the betterment of the world. I dream
                        of being at the forefront of technological innovation, driving progress in transformative fields such as
                        artificial intelligence, fully autonomous transportation, commercial space travel, and the possibility of
                        living on other planets.</p>
                    <p>I have been unemployed since graduation, unable to land employment opportunities due to the lack of internship
                        experience and software development projects that showcase my technical skills. During this unemployment period,
                        I began studying and diving deeper into full-stack development, as well as data science and machine learning,
                        striving to continuously learn and improve myself as a software engineer.</p>
                    <p>In my spare time, I like to work on projects, work out, play basketball, and play some games.</p>
