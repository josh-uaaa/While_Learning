The **Full_Stack** directory of **While_Learning** documents my comprehensive journey in becoming
a proficient full stack software engineer, encompassing both frontend and backend development using
industry-leading tools, libraries, and frameworks.

### _Purpose_

modern libraries such as `React`.
- Deepen my understanding of backend development with `Java`, `Spring Boot`, `Express.js`, and
other key frameworks.

between server and client.
