## While_Learning

```python
while True:
  learn()
```

In reference to a fundamental construct in programming, the `while` loop, the **While_Learning** repository serves as a documentation
of my dedication towards continuously learning, growing, and improving myself as an aspiring software developer.

This repository stores notes, exercises, coding challenges, and mini projects that I have written and completed as part of this journey,
spanning multiple programming languages and concepts, reflecting my ongoing commitment to enhancing and expanding my knowledge and
technical skill.

Note that projects relatively larger than the mini projects found in this repository will not be stored here, but rather in their own
individual repositories in order for projects to stand out as their own separate entities while maintaining **While_Learning**'s focus
on my learning journey and progression.
